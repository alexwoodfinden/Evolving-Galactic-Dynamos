The follow is a python program written to automate data analysis and comparisons of models rotation measure maps with observational rotation measure maps (see Sect. \ref{sect:imp}).  Model rotation measure maps are prodiced from MAPLE scripts and output as .csv files.  Information needed on the model rotation measure maps are stored in the neccessary input file rmModels.csv, each line of this file corresponds to a different rotation measure model image.  Information needed on the observational rotation measure maps are stored in neccessary input file rmMaps.csv, each line of this file corresponds to a different observational rotation measure map.  This script needs to be ran from within the Casa shell.  This script has been tested using Casa version 4.7 and Python 2.7.  Parameters to change are located in rmMaps.csv and rmModels.csv.

Input file rmModels.csv must have the information needed in the following order separated by commas (as this is a .csv file): model rotation measure map file name for quadrant 1 (as a string), dynamo description (as a string), parameter vector (as a string), whether or not data for the second quadrant exist (as a Boolean), model rotation measure map file name for quadrant 2 (as a string), whether or not the model image for quadrant 2 needs to be flipped along the x-axis (as a Boolean, this is generally true), whether or not the model image for quadrant 2 needs to be flipped along the y-axis (as a Boolean, this is generally false), whether or not data for the third quadrant exist (as a Boolean), model rotation measure map file name for quadrant 3 (as a string), whether or not the model image for quadrant 3 needs to be flipped along the x-axis (as a Boolean, this is generally true), whether or not the model image for quadrant 3 needs to be flipped along the y-axis (as a Boolean, this is generally true), whether or not data for the forth quadrant exist (as a Boolean), model rotation measure map file name for quadrant 4 (as a string), whether or not the model image for quadrant 4 needs to be flipped along the x-axis (as a Boolean, this is generally false), whether or not the model image for quadrant 4 needs to be flipped along the y-axis (as a Boolean, this is generally true).  For each additional model rotation measure image the same information needs to be included on a separate line.  An example of a valid line for this file is: "outflowModelQ1-m=0q=1.0w=5e=0.0.csv", "Outflow Model", "{m,q,epsilon,w,T,C1,C2} = {0,1.0,0.,5,1,1,0}", True, "outflowModelQ2-m=0q=1.0w=5e=0.0.csv", True, False, True, "outflowModelQ3-m=0q=1.0w=5e=0.0.csv", True, True, False,"outflowModelQ4-m=0q=1.0w=5e=0.0.csv", False, False.      

Input file rmModels.csv must have the information needed in the following order separated by commas: observational rotation measure map file name (as a string), galaxy diameter in degrees (as a float), x-coordinate of the lower left corner of box used in data analysis (see red box on Fig. \ref{fig:Carolina}) in pixel coordinates (as an integer), y-coordinate of the lower left corner of box used in data analysis in pixel coordinates (as an integer), x-coordinate of the upper right corner of box used in data analysis in pixel coordinates (as an integer), y-coordinate of the upper right corner of box used in data analysis in pixel coordinates (as an integer), x-coordinate of the center of the galaxy in pixel coordinates (as an integer), y-coordinate of the center of the galaxy in pixel coordinates (as an integer), lower bound of the x-range to plot in pixel coordinates (as an integer), upper bound of the x-range to plot in pixel coordinates (as an integer), lower bound of the y-range to plot in pixel coordinates (as an integer), upper bound of the y-range to plot in pixel coordinates (as an integer).  For each additional observational rotation measure image the same information needs to be included on a separate line.  An example of a valid line for this file is: "NGC4631_MoraP_RMsynth_RM_4.rotated.fits", 6.5/60, 147, 174, 225, 188, 197, 165, 100, 294, 115, 215.

Inputs needed: rmModels.csv, rmMaps.csv, python script to convert Maple output to .fits file.  

Output: will produce a folder for each observational image, inside is a folder for each model rotation measure map containing regridded model RM image, the observational image, and a residual image from subtracting the model image from the observational image; a folder called medians.txt is created that will contain a line for each model and observational map compared with the median of the residual image, median absolute deviation of the residual image, standard deviation of the residual image, and AIC of the fit for the box used in the data analysis
